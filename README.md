# Menstrual Cycle Predictor 📅

Welcome to the Menstrual Cycle Predictor! This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the next cycle length and period date based on historical menstrual cycle data.

## How it Works 🤖

Using the provided dataset containing information such as cycle length, period length, and last menstrual date, this predictor leverages linear regression to model the relationship between cycle attributes and menstrual dates. The trained model can then forecast the length of the next cycle and predict the date of the next period.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with the Menstrual Cycle Predictor:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed, including Pandas and Scikit-learn.
2. **Load the Dataset**: Import your dataset containing menstrual cycle data from a CSV file.
3. **Train the Model**: Extract relevant features from the dataset, split the data into training and testing sets, and train the linear regression model.
4. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict the next cycle length and period date based on the provided cycle and period lengths.

## Usage 📋

Here's how you can use the Menstrual Cycle Predictor:

1. Prepare your dataset in the same format as the provided example.
2. Run the Python script to train the model and make predictions.
3. View the predicted next cycle length and period date.
